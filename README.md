# File Upload Manager

## Overview
**File Upload Manager** is a simple web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to upload and view files directly in the browser. This lightweight project demonstrates the core functionality of file handling on the client side without relying on a backend server.

## Features
- **File Upload:** Select and upload files through an intuitive web interface.  
- **File Preview:** Instantly view uploaded files such as images, text files, and other supported formats.  
- **Responsive Design:** Clean and minimal interface that works across various devices.  
- **Lightweight Implementation:** Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no dependencies required.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Structure and layout of the application.  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Client-side logic for file upload and display.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.  
2. Click on the **Upload File** button to choose a file from your computer.  
3. Once uploaded, the file preview will be displayed immediately on the screen.  
4. Repeat the process to upload and view multiple files.
